msh-programs
============

In CSCI 352 at Western Washington University we make a small shell program called the minishell, or msh. By the end of the quarter, the msh has developed into a turing-complete beast, with fancy features like 'if statements', and 'while loops'.

These are programs written to run on the mini-language msh defines.
